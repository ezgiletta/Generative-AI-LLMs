# Comprehensive Overview of LLMs

This document provides an in-depth look into various aspects of Large Language Models (LLMs).

<details>
<summary><b>LLMs</b></summary>

- As the number of parameters within a model increases, so does its demand for memory. This expansion not only necessitates more storage but also enhances the model's capability to tackle increasingly complex tasks.

- The input text provided to a Large Language Model (LLM) is referred to as a prompt. The available memory or capacity allocated for this prompt is known as the context window. Generally, the context window can accommodate several thousand words, although its size varies across different models. The text generated by the model is termed a completion, and the process of employing the model to produce text is identified as inference.

### Collection of the Base LLMs
 - GPT
 - BLOOM
 - LLaMa
 - FLAN-T5
 - PaLM 
 - BERT

<summary><b>Transformers</b></summary>

- **Transformers over RNNs**: Transformers improve upon RNNs by efficiently processing all words in a sentence simultaneously, enabling better performance in natural language tasks.
- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Enables the model to understand the context and relevance of each word in relation to every other word in the input, regardless of their position, significantly enhancing language understanding and generation capabilities.
- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: The transformer model is split into two parts: the encoder, which processes the input text, and the decoder, which generates the output text. These components share a number of similarities and work in conjunction.
- **Tokenization**: Text must be converted into tokens, representing either whole words or parts of words, which are then used by the model for processing. The choice of tokenizer affects the model's understanding and generation of text.  In general, word are used as tokens.
- **Embedding Layer**: Maps each token to a high-dimensional vector space, allowing the model to capture the meaning and context of each token. Positional encodings are added to maintain word order. In original transformer paper, the vector size is 512. The vector weights of the embeddings are updated through backpropagation.
- **Multi-Headed Self-Attention**: A key feature where multiple sets of attention weights (heads) learn different aspects of the language independently. This allows the model to focus on various relationships within the text simultaneously. The weights of the self-attention mechanismâ€”including those for each head are randomly initialized. 
- **Feed-Forward Network**: Processes the output from the self-attention mechanism, resulting in logits that represent the probability scores for each possible word in the dictionary(tokens). 
- **Softmax Layer**: Normalizes the logits into a probability distribution over all words in the vocabulary, with the highest probability indicating the most likely next word. 

### Different Types of Transformer Models

1. **Encoder-only Models** (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa)
   - **Use Cases**: Ideal for classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis.
   - **Pre-training Method**: Masked Language Modeling (MLM).
   - **Objective**: Denoising objective to predict masked tokens and reconstruct the original sentence.
   - **Features**: Builds bi-directional representations of the input sequence, understanding the full context around each token.

2. **Encoder-decoder Models** (e.g., BART, T5)
   - **Use Cases**: Suitable for sequence-to-sequence tasks like translation, summarization, and question-answering.
   - **Pre-training Method**: Span Corruption.
   - **Objective**: The encoder masks random sequences of input tokens replaced by a unique Sentinel token. The decoder's task is to reconstruct the masked token sequences auto-regressively.
   - **Features**: Utilizes both the encoder and decoder components of the original transformer architecture. Sentinel tokens do not correspond to any actual word but are placeholders for masked sequences.

3. **Decoder-only Models** (e.g., GPT series, BLOOM, Jurassic, LLaMA)
   - **Use Cases**: Primarily used for text generation. Larger models demonstrate strong zero-shot inference abilities for a range of tasks.
   - **Pre-training Method**: Causal Language Modeling.
   - **Objective**: Predict the next token based on the previous sequence of tokens, focusing on autoregressive training.
   - **Features**: Employs the decoder component of the original architecture, enabling unidirectional context. Models are trained to build a statistical representation of language by learning to predict the next word.

### End-to-end process of the transformers (Translation)

1. Tokenization of input words with the same tokenizer used in network training.
2. Tokens fed into the encoder, passing through the embedding layer and multi-headed attention layers.
3. Encoder outputs, a deep representation of the input sequence's structure and meaning, fed into the decoder.
4. Start of sequence token triggers the decoder to predict the next token, based on encoder-provided context.
5. Decoder outputs pass through its feed-forward network and softmax output layer to predict tokens until an end-of-sequence token is reached.
6. The process concludes with detokenizing the final sequence of tokens into the output sentence.

<summary><b>Computational Challenges</b></summary>

Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is highly memory-intensive. Efficient memory management is crucial due to the massive number of parameters involved. This document summarizes the key aspects of memory requirements and strategies for optimizing memory usage during the training of LLMs.

### Memory Requirements for LLMs

- **Storing Model Weights**: A single parameter in a model, represented as a 32-bit float, requires four bytes of memory. Consequently, storing one billion parameters necessitates approximately 4 GB of GPU RAM just for the model weights.

### Additional Memory Needs During Training

- **Training Overheads**: Additional components such as the Adam optimizer states, gradients, activations, and temporary variables significantly increase memory requirements. For a one billion parameter model, the memory needed can be approximately 24 GB of GPU RAM, which is about 6 times the memory required just for storing the model weights.

### Quantization: A Strategy to Reduce Memory Usage

- **What is Quantization?**: Quantization involves reducing the precision of the model weights from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower precision formats like 16-bit (FP16 or BFLOAT16) or even 8-bit integers (int8). This reduces the memory footprint significantly.

- **FP32 vs. FP16 vs. BFLOAT16**:
  - **FP32 (32-bit Full Precision)**: Uses 1 bit for the sign, 8 bits for the exponent, and 23 bits for the fraction (mantissa).
  - **FP16 (16-bit Half Precision)**: Reduces the exponent to 5 bits and the fraction to 10 bits, cutting the memory requirement in half compared to FP32.
  - **BFLOAT16**: Maintains the 8-bit exponent of FP32 but reduces the fraction to 7 bits, offering a balance between dynamic range and memory efficiency.

### Challenges with Large Models

- **Scaling Challenges**: As model sizes reach tens or hundreds of billions of parameters, memory requirements become vast, necessitating distributed computing across multiple GPUs.

### Fine-tuning Large Models

- **Memory Considerations**: Fine-tuning involves adjusting pre-trained model parameters for specific tasks, which also demands substantial memory, though less than training from scratch.

## Model Training Insights

### Dataset vs. Model Parameters
- Increasing the size of the training dataset or the number of model parameters can improve performance, within the constraints of the available compute budget.

### Compute Resources for Pre-training
- **Example**: Training large models like GPT-3 (175 billion parameters) necessitates substantial compute resources, approximately 3,700 petaFLOP per second days, in contrast to 100 for T5 XL (3 billion parameters).

### Trade-offs
- Research shows well-defined relationships between dataset size, model size, and compute budget, with performance improvements following a power-law relationship with the compute budget.

## Findings from the Chinchilla Paper

### Overparameterization
- Models like GPT-3 may have more parameters than necessary ("overparameterized") and could benefit from larger training datasets ("undertrained").

### Optimal Training Dataset Size
- **Rule of Thumb**: The optimal size is about 20 times the number of model parameters. For a model with 70 billion parameters, the ideal dataset contains 1.4 trillion tokens.

### Compute Optimal Models
- Smaller models trained on larger datasets can achieve comparable or better performance than larger models trained less optimally.

<summary><b>Instruction Fine Tuning</b></summary>

## Introduction

Fine-tuning is a pivotal process in optimizing pre-trained Large Language Models for specific tasks. This document explores various fine-tuning strategies, including single-task fine-tuning, multitask fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and the use of models fine-tuned with these strategies, such as the FLAN family of models.

## Fine-Tuning vs. Pre-Training

- **Pre-Training**: Training LLMs using vast amounts of unstructured textual data for a general understanding.
- **Fine-Tuning**: A supervised learning process using labeled examples (prompt-completion pairs) to refine the model's responses to specific tasks.

## Single-Task Fine-Tuning and Catastrophic Forgetting

Single-task fine-tuning enhances a model's performance on a specific area but may lead to catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses its ability to perform previously learned tasks.

### Strategies to Mitigate Catastrophic Forgetting

- Assess the impact on your use case.
- Consider multitask fine-tuning to maintain generalization capabilities.

<summary><b>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for LLMs</b></summary>

## Overview
Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is a computationally intensive process, requiring significant memory resources not just for storing the model weights but also for optimizer states, gradients, forward activations, and temporary memory throughout the training process. PEFT methods offer a more memory-efficient way of fine-tuning LLMs by updating a small subset of parameters, thus making training more accessible on consumer hardware.

## Key Points

- **Memory Requirements**: Full fine-tuning of LLMs demands substantial memory for various components, often exceeding the capacity of consumer hardware. PEFT significantly reduces the memory footprint by focusing on a small subset of model parameters.
- **Parameter Efficiency**: Most PEFT techniques keep the bulk of the LLM weights frozen, updating only 15-20% of the weights or adding a minimal number of new parameters for fine-tuning.
- **Model Adaptability**: PEFT enables the original model to be adapted for multiple tasks with minimal modifications, reducing storage requirements and mitigating catastrophic forgetting problems associated with full fine-tuning.
- **Footprint**: The smaller number of parameters trained with PEFT results in a much smaller overall footprint, sometimes as small as megabytes depending on the task.

## Methods of PEFT

PEFT can be categorized into three main classes:

1. **Selective Methods**: These methods involve fine-tuning only a subset of the original LLM parameters. Options include targeting specific components, layers, or parameter types. However, these methods may involve trade-offs between parameter efficiency and computational efficiency.

2. **Reparameterization Methods**: This approach works with the original LLM parameters but reduces the number of parameters to train through new, low-rank transformations of the original network weights. An example of this method is LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation).

3. **Additive Methods**: Additive methods involve keeping all the original LLM weights frozen and introducing new trainable components. Two main approaches under this category are:
   - **Adapter Methods**: New trainable layers are added to the architecture of the model, typically within the encoder or decoder components.
   - **Soft Prompt Methods**: The model architecture remains fixed and frozen, with fine-tuning achieved by manipulating the input. This can include adding trainable parameters to the prompt embeddings or retraining the embedding weights.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models</b></summary>

## Introduction

Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique within the reparameterization category. It aims to reduce the number of trainable parameters during fine-tuning by introducing a pair of rank decomposition matrices alongside the original model weights. This technique allows for significant memory and computational efficiency improvements, making fine-tuning feasible on less powerful hardware.

## How LoRA Works

### Transformer Architecture

- The process starts with an input prompt turned into tokens, which are then converted to embedding vectors.
- These vectors pass through the encoder and/or decoder components of the transformer, involving self-attention and feedforward neural networks.

### Fine-Tuning with LoRA

- Unlike full fine-tuning, which updates every parameter, LoRA freezes the original model parameters.
- It injects a pair of low-rank matrices to modify the weights, with dimensions ensuring their product matches the original weights' dimensions.
- For inference, these matrices are multiplied and added to the original weights, updating the model with minimal impact on inference latency.

### Practical Example

- Considering a transformer with weights dimensions of 512 by 64, full fine-tuning would update all 32,768 parameters.
- With LoRA, and choosing a rank of 8, you only train two matrices with dimensions of 8 by 64 and 512 by 8, resulting in just 4,608 parameters â€“ an 86% reduction.

## Choosing the Rank for LoRA Matrices

- The rank choice is crucial, balancing between reducing parameters and maintaining model performance.
- Research indicates a performance plateau for ranks greater than 16, suggesting a rank range of 4-32 offers a good trade-off.

<details>
<summary><b>Prompt Tuning: A Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Method</b></summary>

## Overview

Prompt tuning is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that significantly differs from traditional fine-tuning approaches by adding trainable tokens to the model's prompt instead of adjusting the model's weights. This approach allows for efficient model adaptation to new tasks without the computational burden of training millions to billions of parameters.

## Prompt Tuning vs. Prompt Engineering

- **Prompt Engineering**: Involves manually crafting the language of your prompt to improve the model's output. This can be through simple word changes or by including examples for few-shot inference. However, it can be labor-intensive and limited by the model's context window size.
- **Prompt Tuning**: Adds additional trainable tokens (soft prompts) to your prompt, which are optimized through supervised learning to improve task performance. This method is computationally efficient, requiring the training of only a few parameters compared to the full model.

## How Prompt Tuning Works

1. **Soft Prompts**: Trainable tokens called soft prompts are prepended to the embedding vectors representing your input text. These vectors can be adjusted to optimize model performance for a specific task.
2. **Virtual Tokens**: Unlike hard tokens, which correspond to fixed points in the embedding space, soft prompts are virtual tokens. They can take any value within the embedding space, allowing the model to learn task-specific representations.
3. **Supervised Learning**: During prompt tuning, the LLM's weights remain frozen. Only the embedding vectors of the soft prompts are updated to optimize the model's responses to prompts.
4. **Parameter Efficiency**: Prompt tuning trains far fewer parameters than traditional fine-tuning, offering a more resource-efficient way to adapt models to new tasks.

## Performance and Applications

- **Model Performance**: Initial research shows that prompt tuning performs comparably to full fine-tuning with large models (approximately 10 billion parameters), significantly outperforming prompt engineering alone.
- **Interpretability**: Although the learned virtual tokens don't correspond to natural language words, analysis shows they form semantic clusters related to the task, indicating task-specific learning.

<summary><b>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)</b></summary>

- **Introduction:**
  - Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with human feedback can significantly improve their ability to summarize text.
  - The method called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is particularly effective for this purpose.

- **How RLHF Works:**
  - RLHF employs reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune LLMs based on human feedback, aiming to produce outputs that align with human preferences.
  - This approach helps in minimizing potential harm by training models to acknowledge their limitations and avoid toxic language.

- **Applications of RLHF:**
  - Personalization of LLMs, where the models learn individual user preferences through continuous feedback, leading to potential applications like individualized learning plans or personalized AI assistants.

- **Basics of Reinforcement Learning:**
  - In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions to achieve a goal by interacting with an environment, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards.
  - The agent improves its decision-making strategy over time through trial and error, continually refining its actions based on rewards or penalties.

- **Applying RLHF to LLMs:**
  - In the context of LLMs, the agent (LLM) generates text aligned with human preferences based on the input prompt.
  - The environment is the model's context window, and actions involve generating text from the token vocabulary.
  - Rewards are assigned based on how well the completions align with human preferences, with the goal of producing helpful, accurate, and non-toxic text.

- **Reward Model:**
  - A secondary model, known as the reward model, is used to assess LLM outputs and evaluate their alignment with human preferences.
  - The reward model is trained with a smaller number of human examples and then used to update the LLM's weights, leading to a human-aligned version of the model.

- **Goal:** Train a smaller "student" model to mimic a larger "teacher" model, reducing size without significantly impacting performance.
- **Process:** Use the teacher model's output to guide the student model, employing a temperature parameter to broaden the probability distribution for learning.
- **Best For:** Models with significant representation redundancy, particularly encoder-only models like BERT.

#### 2. Quantization (Post-Training)

- **Goal:** Lower the precision of model weights to reduce memory footprint and compute resource needs.
- **Process:** Can apply to weights and activation layers, with calibration required to accurately capture parameter value ranges.
- **Impact:** May slightly reduce model performance but can offer significant cost savings and performance gains.

#### 3. Model Pruning

- **Goal:** Remove minimally contributing weights to decrease model size and potentially improve inference performance.
- **Process:** Involves post-training pruning with potential retraining or fine-tuning.
- **Considerations:** Effectiveness varies based on the proportion of near-zero model weights.

### Conclusion

Optimizing an LLM for deployment requires a careful balance between performance, speed, and resource use. Techniques like distillation, quantization, and pruning provide ways to achieve these goals. Tailoring the optimization strategy to your specific needs is key to successful LLM integration and ensuring optimal application performance.

<summary><b>Enhancing Large Language Models with External Data: Overcoming Inherent Limitations</b></summary>

### Inherent Limitations of LLMs

1. **Knowledge Cutoff:** LLMs' understanding of the world is limited to the information available up to the point of their last training. This means their internal knowledge becomes outdated as time passes.

2. **Mathematical Limitations:** While LLMs can approximate calculations, they do not perform actual mathematical operations and can struggle with complex math problems, often leading to incorrect answers.

3. **Hallucination:** LLMs can generate text even when they lack accurate information, leading to fabricated responses (known as hallucinations), such as describing nonexistent entities.

### Overcoming Limitations with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a framework to address some of these limitations by enhancing LLMs with the ability to access external data sources and applications. This approach helps LLMs overcome the knowledge cutoff issue and update their understanding of the world without the need for continuous retraining.

#### How RAG Works

- **Retriever Component:** Central to RAG is the retriever, which consists of a query encoder and an external data source. The encoder processes the user's input and searches the data source for relevant information.
- **Data Sources:** The external data can be a variety of formats, including vector stores, SQL databases, CSV files, or any other structured data storage.
- **Implementation:** The retrieved information is combined with the original user query to form an expanded prompt. This enriched prompt is then fed to the LLM, which generates a response that incorporates the retrieved data.

### Advantages of RAG

- **Up-to-date Information:** By accessing external data sources, RAG allows LLMs to provide responses based on the most current information, circumventing the knowledge cutoff problem.
- **Reduced Hallucination:** Access to accurate, external data helps prevent the model from generating baseless information, addressing the issue of hallucinations.
- **Versatility:** RAG enables LLMs to interact with a wide range of data formats and sources, from local documents and databases to online resources like Wikipedia.

### Implementing RAG: Considerations

- **Context Window Size:** Due to LLMs' limited context window, external data must be segmented into manageable chunks.
- **Data Retrieval:** Effective RAG implementation requires the data to be in a retrievable format, often necessitating the conversion of text into vector representations for efficient searching.

<summary><b>Enhancing Reasoning in Large Language Models Through Chain of Thought Prompting</b></summary>

Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in understanding and generating natural language. However, complex reasoning and multi-step problem-solving, particularly in mathematical contexts, remain challenging for these models. This limitation is evident even in tasks that humans can solve intuitively, such as simple arithmetic or logical reasoning problems.

### The Challenge of Complex Reasoning in LLMs

Consider a scenario where an LLM is asked to solve a multi-step math problem involving a cafeteria's apple inventory. Despite providing the model with a structured example problem to guide its inference process, it may still return an incorrect answer due to its inherent limitations in performing mathematical operations and complex reasoning.

### Improving LLM Reasoning with Chain of Thought Prompting

Researchers have been exploring techniques to enhance LLMs' ability to tackle reasoning tasks more effectively. One promising approach is "chain of thought" prompting, which involves:

- **Structured Problem Solving:** Encouraging the model to break down a problem into a series of intermediate steps, much like how a human would approach the task.
- **Explicit Reasoning Steps:** Including intermediate calculations and logical deductions within the prompt to guide the model through the reasoning process.

### Benefits of Chain of Thought Prompting

- **Improved Accuracy:** By guiding the model through a logical sequence of steps, the accuracy of responses to complex problems can significantly increase.
- **Transparency:** This approach also makes the model's thought process more transparent, allowing users to understand how it arrived at a particular conclusion.

### Limitations and Considerations

While chain of thought prompting enhances reasoning capabilities, it does not entirely overcome LLMs' limitations with precise calculations. For tasks requiring exact numerical accuracy, such as financial calculations or applying mathematical formulas, additional solutions may be necessary.

<summary><b>Enhancing LLMs with External Computational Abilities: Program-Aided Language Models (PAL)</b></summary>

Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating natural language. However, their ability to perform precise arithmetic and complex mathematical operations is limited. This limitation poses challenges in applications requiring exact numerical computations. An innovative approach to overcome these challenges is through Program-Aided Language Models (PAL), which augment LLMs with the ability to execute external code for accurate calculations.

### Limitations of LLMs in Mathematical Operations

- LLMs struggle with performing accurate mathematical calculations, especially with large numbers or complex operations.
- These inaccuracies can lead to significant errors in applications, such as incorrect billing or miscalculations in recipes.

### Overcoming Limitations with PAL

PAL framework combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with the computational precision of external code interpreters, like Python, to enhance the model's ability to conduct precise mathematical operations.

#### How PAL Works

- **Chain of Thought Prompting with Code Generation:** PAL employs chain of thought prompting that includes Python code snippets alongside reasoning steps. This method instructs the LLM to generate executable scripts based on its reasoning.
- **Execution of Generated Code:** The generated scripts are then passed to a Python interpreter for execution, ensuring accurate computation.

#### Structuring PAL Prompts

A PAL prompt integrates:
- **Reasoning Steps:** Narrative descriptions of the problem-solving steps, marked as comments in the code to guide the model.
- **Executable Code:** Python code snippets that perform the actual calculations based on the reasoning steps.

### Implementing PAL in Applications

Implementing PAL requires a structured approach:
1. **Format the Prompt:** Include example problems with solutions expressed through reasoning steps and Python code.
2. **Append New Questions:** Add the new problem you want to solve to the PAL-formatted prompt.
3. **Generate and Execute Code:** Pass the prompt to the LLM to generate a Python script, then execute this script with an interpreter for the solution.
4. **Integrate the Solution:** Append the accurate answer back to the prompt for complete documentation of the problem-solving process.

### Orchestrating PAL with External Interpreters

To automate the interaction between the LLM and the Python interpreter, an orchestrator manages the flow of information and the execution of external code. This component is crucial for efficiently leveraging PAL in real-world applications, where multiple external data sources or computational tools may be involved.

### Advantages of PAL

- **Precision:** Ensures accurate calculations by leveraging the computational abilities of external code interpreters.
- **Flexibility:** Adaptable to various mathematical operations, from basic arithmetic to more complex calculations.
- **Efficiency:** Streamlines the integration of computational precision into LLM-driven applications without manual intervention.

ReAct is a framework designed to augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ability to plan and execute complex workflows, especially useful in applications requiring interactions with multiple external data sources and applications. This strategy combines chain of thought reasoning with actionable steps, enabling LLMs to solve problems that require multi-step reasoning and interactions with external tools.

### Background

Developed by researchers at Princeton and Google in 2022, ReAct was inspired by the need to overcome limitations in current LLMs' ability to handle multi-step question answering and fact verification tasks effectively. The framework has been tested on benchmarks like Hot Pot QA and FEVER, demonstrating its potential to enhance LLMs' problem-solving capabilities.

### How ReAct Works

ReAct employs structured prompting to guide LLMs through a series of reasoning steps (thoughts) and actionable tasks (actions) to derive solutions to complex problems. Here's a breakdown of its components:

- **Thought:** A reasoning step that helps the LLM conceptualize the problem and plan the next action.
- **Action:** A predefined task that the LLM can execute, such as searching for information or retrieving data from external sources like Wikipedia.
- **Observation:** New information gained from executing an action, which is then used to inform subsequent reasoning and actions.

### Example Workflow: Determining Magazine Publication Dates

To illustrate, consider the task of determining which of two magazines was created first. The ReAct prompt would guide the LLM through:

1. Identifying the need to search for the publication dates of both magazines.
2. Executing searches via a Python API to retrieve publication dates from Wikipedia.
3. Comparing the dates to determine which magazine was published earlier.

### Implementing ReAct in Applications

Applications leveraging ReAct must carefully structure prompts to include instructions, examples, and the specific question or task. This structure ensures the LLM can reason effectively and take appropriate actions using a limited set of predefined operations (e.g., search, lookup, finish).

### Integrating with LangChain

LangChain is a framework that provides modular components for developing LLM-powered applications, offering prompt templates, memory storage for LLM interactions, and tools for external data and API interactions. LangChain supports ReAct by enabling developers to construct workflows (chains) optimized for various use cases or to dynamically select actions based on user input (agents).

### Conclusion

ReAct represents a significant advancement in the use of LLMs for complex problem-solving, allowing for sophisticated reasoning and integration with external data sources and applications. When combined with frameworks like LangChain, it offers a powerful toolkit for developing versatile and intelligent AI-powered applications, promising to expand the horizons of what's possible with LLMs.
